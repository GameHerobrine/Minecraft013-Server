# Minecraft013-Server
A Minecraft 0.1.3 server core written on Java. Uses [Old Nukkit's Raknet implementation](https://github.com/Nukkit/Nukkit/tree/6f0efea357326dae477a2ed866ac47f965e1a7f7). 

# Implemented Features

* World Data Loading
* Chunk Data sending
* World modifying
* World Generating (Only flat for now)
* Player data saving/loading


# Compability
* The server works correctly with 0.1.2 - 0.1.3. 0.1.1 works, but chunks do not load correctly.
